Points:
- You should save a detailed info. Not a boolean of the check result.
- To read/write OS level files (e.g. under `/etc` dir), you should add `become: true`. Use grep.
- Do not use `setup` module.
- To save a variable in the playbook, you can use this task.
    ```yaml
    - name: Save a variable content in a localhost
      copy:
        content: {{{{ variable_name | quote }}}}
        dest: collected_data.json
      delegate_to: localhost
      become: false
    ```
  If you try to save a registered variable, do not parse it. Just save it as is.
  `become: false` is necessary for this task because you don't have sudo permission on localhost.
  Use "collected_data.json" and do not change the destination file name.
- Do not try to find "collected_data.json" when not found. Just collect the data again.
- Do not specify absolute path anywhere. You must use the current directory.
- If you need command result as a collected data, you should add `ignore_errors: true` to the task.
- Use Ansible module instead of command, if possible.
